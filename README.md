#### I used two models for this project: ResNet50 and VGG16. I write out two stages:
#### + Stage 1 - using ResNet50 model/VGG16 model for the recognition only and will genre for the voice using pyttsx3). I run the stage 1 in base (python 3.10/3.11).
#### + Stage 2 - using Google mediapipe for detection then ResNet50 model/VGG16 model for the recognition and will genre for the voice sing pyttsx3. I run the stage 1 in another environment (python 3.9). You can refer to the .docx file 4. Hướng Dẫn for creating a python 3.9 environment with related libraries. Or if you can't run also then I will add the right requirements for the setting in the future.
